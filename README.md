Coronavirus (or Covid-19) is a viral infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus). The thesis developed a deep neural network strategy for screening Covid-19 using CXRs that is less expensive, faster, and more accurate, allowing us to protect people from infection with Covid-19. The model of the convolutional neural network has nine layers, seven of which are convolutional base layers and two of which are dense layers. Four factors define the model's effectiveness: false positive (FP), true positive (TP), false negative (FN), and true negative (TN). The trained model has an accuracy of 0.985, whereas the testing accuracy of the model was 0.8. The true positive rate, true negative rate, false positive rate, and false negative rate of the classifier are 20%, 60%, 10%, and 10%, respectively. The developed model's accuracy, recall, and f1-score are all 0.667.
